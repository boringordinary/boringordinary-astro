        It was 2013, and we wanted to sell online. To introduce our first
        product to market, we built websites unlike the e-commerce world had
        seen. We designed the site, branding, and media that cut through the
        noise. When those websites got more attention than the product did, we
        realized we might be on to something.

        There’s a theory that your style is the way that you make mistakes in
        ways that only you can make them. We developed our style by doing things
        wrong in ways that felt right. In fact, the company was started on
        accident.
